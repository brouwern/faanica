Description: The goal of faanica is to replicate and extend the results from 
  papers published by John Faaborg et al on their long-term monitoring project 
  at Guanica Forest, Puerto Rico.  In various publications Faaborg et al have 
  released summary tables of total captures by species.  faanica is a repository
  for those data tables as well as worked examples in the vignettes of regression analysis similar
  to those in the original papers.  There are also vignettes extending the analyses
  to use, e.g., mixed models, autocorrelation, and community analyses.
